More stupid amateur epidemiology.
==================================


Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, so I had to try it out.

I am trying the technique from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc but on California County data from the New York Times.

To fetch the nytimes data try

`git submodule update --init`

from this folder.

To update the nytimes data, `cd covid-19-data` then `git pull` then `cd ..`

You can rerun the cells that load the data without restarting the notebook.

To view the notebook, run `jupyter notebook` from this folder.

You'll need python3, numpy, and matplotlib.
